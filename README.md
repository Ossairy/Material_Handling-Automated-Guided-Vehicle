# Material_Handling-Automated-Guided-Vehicle


Project Objective :  
   
    the project objective is to design ,manufacture and control Automated Guided Vehicle for material handeling uses.
    
Project Duration :
    
    October 2022 : May 2023 ; After successfuly produced AGV for hospital and hotels cleanning, we wanted to produce another model for material handeling .
    
Project Description :   
    First the AGV is designed and modeled on Solidworks and then the designed parts is manufactured using LASER cutting machine and conventional Lathe, then assembled in GUC LAB , The control equiped with the AGV is using ThouthFirmware which is AGV firmware -will be open source soon-.
    The AGV is designed to meet the light duty industerial needs ,with 100kg payload and 7 hours of avg. working hours and 2 hours of charging, however that agv is targeting the accademic uses since the whole system is under development phase and the software used is going to be offered open source to let the AGV accademic community develop on it to outcome a reliable version at the end.
